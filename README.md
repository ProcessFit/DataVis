# DataVis
Development of data visualisations for quantitative hierarchies

## History
This set of visualisations was developed as part of a thesis for Masters of Data Science at Monash Univerisity.

Originally, the code was based on a node.js implementation, using mongo.db to capture mouse clicks and user interactions, and was deployed on Heroku.

In 2023, the code has been refactored to a static website, hosted on an AWS S3 bucket [cloud-vis](http://cloud-vis.com).

Original files can be found, on previous commits, with the current version showing static websites, generated via Pug. Most functionality in the viz comes from the javascript files.
